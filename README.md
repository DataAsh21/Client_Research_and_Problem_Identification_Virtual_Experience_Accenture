## Introduction

Industrobots, a leading player in the consumer robotics industry, embarked on an ambitious journey to revolutionize its sales process for the iDROID consumer product.

## Tasks Completed ✔️

### Task 1: Requirements Gathering Project Plan 📝

The first task involved creating a Requirements Gathering Project Plan for the sales process transformation. The plan outlined the scope, objectives, and engagement strategy for the project. It also included recommendations for interview and documentation requests to understand stakeholder needs effectively.

### Task 2: Stakeholder Interview Guides 🎤

In the second task, we designed interview guides for two key stakeholders: the VP of Marketing at Industrobots and the VP of Strategic Partnerships at a home security services provider. These interview guides helped us understand their priorities, motivations, and concerns related to the sales process transformation.

### Task 3: Requirements Gathering Process Maps 🗺️

The third task focused on creating "As-Is" and "To-Be" process maps for the sales cycle. The "As-Is" process depicted the existing RFP-driven sales cycle, while the "To-Be" process showcased the future web-driven automated consumer sales cycle. These process maps highlighted the changes in the sales approach, volume, automation, and customer interaction.
